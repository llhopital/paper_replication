This repository contains replication packages for my research papers, which are listed at zamid.co.uk. Each folder corresponds to a specific paper and includes a self-contained replication package.
Most folders include a replicate_results.m script that reproduces the key figures and quantitative results presented in the paper. Please note that these scripts generally do not replicate summary statistics or other descriptive content that does not require significant processing or inference.
For paper-specific guidance, please refer to the individual README files within each folder.
